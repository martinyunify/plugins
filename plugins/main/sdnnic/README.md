# sdn plugin

## Overview

The sdn plugin invokes back end service defined in configuration.
The backend service should attach a new nic to this instance and return the nic index.
The traffic of the container interface will be routed through the newly attached interface.

## Example network configuration

```json
{
	"name": "mynet",
	"type": "ptp",
	"ipam": {
		"type": "host-local",
		"subnet": "10.1.1.0/24"
	},
	"dns": {
		"nameservers": [ "10.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8" ]
	}
}
```
